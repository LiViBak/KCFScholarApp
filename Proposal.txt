1. The Knox County Foundation is a nonprofit organization with the goal of improving the quality of life in Knox County through charitable giving. The organization focuses on emerging and changing community needs mainly in the fields of: education, youth services, recreation, arts and culture and social services. The Foundation receives money from donors and provides grants and scholarships for community members. The scholarship application we will be working on is a vocational scholarship, which is available  to residents of Knox County who are attending, or will attend, an occupational training program of two-years or less at an accredited vocational school, technical school, community college, or junior college.
